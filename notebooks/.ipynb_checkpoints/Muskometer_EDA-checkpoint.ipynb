The compound measure, on the other hand, ignores neutral words entirely.  This gives me the idea that I might consider constructing more features.  One might be called \"Laconian\", the abs(compound)/(number of words), the valence density. Another might be called \"Belabored\", abs(compound)*sigmoid(10.*(neu-.5)), which will be a measure of how much the valence dense words are broken up by neutral words."
